# Origin Notifications

See https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin/issues/806 ðŸ‘Š

## Getting Started

### The Easy Way

We recommend [running Origin Box](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md#using-docker-compose) to simplify the process of configuring and running all of the modules within the Origin Monorepo.

### The Not-As-Easy Way

If you're interested in running just the notifications service (and the event listener) without messaging, attestations, etc, here are some suggestions for making that happen:

In origin-notifications:

  - Install and run [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
  - Run `yarn global add web-push`
  - Run `web-push generate-vapid-keys`
  - Add database url, email address, public and private keys to origin-notifications/.env
  ```
  DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost/notification
  VAPID_EMAIL_ADDRESS=XXXXXXXXXX-your-email-address-XXXXXXXXXX
  VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=XXXXXXXXXX-your-private-key-XXXXXXXXXX
  VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=XXXXXXXXXX-your-public-key-XXXXXXXXXX
  ```
  - Run `createdb notification`
  - Run `yarn global add sequelize-cli`
  - Run `sequelize db:migrate`
  - Run `npm run start:development`

In origin-dapp:

  - Add public key and notifications url to origin-dapp/.env
  ```
  NOTIFICATIONS_KEY=XXXXXXXXXX-your-public-key-XXXXXXXXXX
  NOTIFICATIONS_URL=http://localhost:3456/
  ```
  - Run `yarn start`

In origin-discovery:

  - Add variables to origin-discovery/.env
  ```
  AFFILIATE_ACCOUNT=0x821aea9a577a9b44299b9c15c88cf3087f3b5544
  ARBITRATOR_ACCOUNT=0x0d1d4e623d10f9fba5db95830f7d3839406c6af2
  BLOCK_EPOCH=0
  DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost/discovery
  NETWORK_ID=999
  IPFS_URL=http://localhost:8080/
  WEB3_URL=http://localhost:8545/
  ```
  - Run `node src/listener/listener.js --continue-file=continue --webhook=http://localhost:3456/events`

  (From time to time, you may need to `rm continue` in origin-discovery.)

To test in the DApp...

1. Create a listing
1. Enable notifications
1. Make an offer from a different account
