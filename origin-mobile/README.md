# Origin Wallet

[![app-store](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/273937/52288003-25b7b700-2920-11e9-9c9a-0a76d04e0c99.png)](https://itunes.apple.com/app/origin-wallet/id1446091928)

Read about Origin Wallet [on Medium](https://medium.com/originprotocol/introducing-origin-wallet-decentralized-commerce-goes-mobile-ecb0f41aa543).

Origin Wallet is an "ejected" React Native application. Go [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#installing-dependencies) to read about getting started with React Native. This application was created with the now-archived [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

## Local Development

This guide will help you to install a local build of Origin Wallet on a device or simulator so that you can modify the application itself. An alternative would be to connect the App Store or TestFlight version of the application to a local blockchain running on your machine, which would be a simpler way to test with Origin Wallet.

### Dependencies

You should be familiar with running Origin.js and the DApp outside of Origin Box as described [here](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md#using-npm--lerna).

Install the following:

- [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/): `brew install watchman`

- [React Native CLI](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/understanding-cli): `npm install -g react-native-cli`

- [Redis](https://redis.io/): `brew install redis`

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

#### iOS Development

- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

- Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`

#### Android Development

- [Android SDK or Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) - If you're on Linux, find the instructions for your specific distribution

- jre-openjdk

### Backend Services

Either follow the guide for Origin Box **OR** Manual Setup to get your backend services running.

#### Origin Box

You can use [Origin Box](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md) for development, however, there are a couple of additional steps you must perform for it to work for origin-mobile.

- Manually run [origin-linking](#Startup) following the instructions under "Manual Setup" below since it is not included in the Box

- Expose PostgreSQL's port 5432 in `docker-compose.yml`

#### Manual Setup

##### Environment Variables

You will need to create five `.env` files to hold the environment variables that are required by [origin-dapp](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin/tree/master/origin-dapp), [origin-discovery](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin/tree/master/origin-discovery), [origin-linking](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin/tree/master/origin-linking), [origin-mobile](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin/tree/master/origin-mobile), and [origin-notifications](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin/tree/master/origin-notifications). Here are examples with suggested values:

```

In the origin-linking and origin-notifications `.env` files, two of the values will need to match. Add any string of your choice to both the `NOTIFY_TOKEN` and `LINKING_NOTIFY_TOKEN` values.

If you want to test with mobile Safari on the same device as the application, find your computer's [internal WiFi network IP address](https://www.wikihow.com/Find-Your-IP-Address-on-a-Mac#Finding_Your_Internal_IP_.28OS_X_10.4.29_sub) and add it to the `MOBILE_LOCALHOST_IP` value for origin-dapp.

##### Setup
- Start PostgreSQL
- Start Redis: `redis-server`
- `createdb origin`
- origin $ `npm run install:mobile` ðŸ‘ˆ instead of `npm install` at the Origin monorepo root
- origin/origin-linking $ `npm run migrate`

#### Startup
- origin/origin-js $ `npm run build:watch` (compiles `dist` directory with build)
- origin/origin-linking $ `npm run start`
- origin/origin-dapp $ `ORIGIN_LINKING=1 LINKER_HOST=(your_ip_address) npm run start`
- origin/origin-mobile $ `npm run install-local`
- origin/origin-mobile $ `npm run start -- --reset-cache`
- Open Xcode and build for your desired device

### Android Device Configuration

If you intend to develop using a physical device rather than a VM, make sure you complete the following.  You can use [the Android developer's guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device) for reference.

- Connect your phone to your machine with a USB cable
- Make sure `JAVA_HOME` points to Android's java (for me, at: `/opt/android-studio/jre/`)
- Run `sdkmanager --licenses` and accept license agreements
- Enable developer mode on your device by tapping "Build number" in settings 7 times.
- Turn on "USB Debugging" in "Developer options"
- Start the adb server `adb start-server`
- Verify your device is recognized with `adb devices`
- Setup TCP tunnels to your device by running `./setup_android_tunnels.sh`. This allows the mobile app to access backend services at `localhost`

### Running Development

To run the mobile app on your phone, you need to both start the Metro builder service, and launch the app on your device.

- Run Metro builder with `npm run start`
- Compile and build your app with `react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios`

### Tips

> Is there a way to remotely debug the app?

You can access the React-Native remote debugger at http://localhost:8081/debugger-ui/

> How do I access the developer menu in the app?

Shake you phone.  Or pretend you did by sending this keycode: `adb shell input keyevent 82`

> Is there a way to trigger a reload on Android?

You can do this from the developer menu, or by running this in your terminal: `adb shell input text "RR"`

### Troubleshooting

> Linker command failed with exit codeâ€¦

- origin/origin-mobile $ `npm run ios`
- Close simulator
- In Xcode, Project > Clean Build Folder
- Try again

-----------

> error: bundling failed: Error: Unable to resolve module origin/common/enums...

This can be caused by not running `npm run install-local` or not _rerunning_ it after doing a root-level `npm install` (which deletes various things from origin/origin-mobile/node_modules).

-----------

Check [the React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/troubleshooting).

-----------

ðŸ“² Don't forget to have WiFi enabled on your both of your devices and connected.

-----------

> unable to load script from assets index.android.bundle
https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin/tree/mikeshultz/android/origin-mobile
This is likely a network error because your tunnels are not setup.  See [Android Device Configuration](#android-device-configuration).

-----------

> FATAL ERROR: Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory

Add the `NODE_OPTIONS` env var to your Metro builder startup command to add the `--max_old_space_size` option like this:

    NODE_OPTIONS="--max_old_space_size=8196" npm run start

-----------

    INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE: Package com.origincatcher signatures do not match previously installed version; ignoring!

Uninstall the app from your phone and try again.
